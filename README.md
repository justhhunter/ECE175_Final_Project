#game of train notes/ how to play guide

sort cards in descending order

player 1 first turn: takes 1 card from draw pile, then places it in his train by
replacing one of the cards that are already there

replaced card goes into centerRow face up

player 2 first turn: draws 2 cards discards one of his choice, 
and replaces one of his cards with the remaining card he drew. The replaced card
goes into the centerRow

Now you can draw a card from the draw pile, or you use a special ability from 
the center row


abilities: 

shift2right: move one of your cards two positions to the right

protect: protects your card to prevent it from being lost, but ifyou move it it loses protection

shift2left: move one of your cards two positions to the left

swapAdjascent: exchange two cards in your hand that are next to eachother

removemiddle: takes away the middle card from all players, they are added to centerrow

if protected the card wont be removed, also players draw cards to replace removed ones

removeright: same as remove middle just for farthest right card

removeleft: same as remove middle just for farthest left card

swapskip1card: ??? swap 2 cards with a card in the middle between them



if two cards with same ability exist in middle of table they are discarded
